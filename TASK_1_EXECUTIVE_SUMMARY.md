# Task 1: Executive Summary
## Legacy QlikSense Migration to Modern dbt + BigQuery + Google Sheets Architecture

### 🎯 **Business Challenge**
Native Instruments' finance team faces critical performance issues with their 15+ year old "Balance and Transactions" QlikSense application, which can no longer efficiently support end-of-month accounting processes due to data volume and system limitations.

### 💡 **Proposed Solution**
**Modern Cloud-Native Financial Data Platform**
- **dbt Core** for transformation logic and data modeling
- **BigQuery** for scalable data warehouse with 15+ years of historical data
- **Google Sheets** (Connected Sheets) for familiar user interface
- **Automated ETL** replacing manual QlikSense scripts

### 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

#### Data Flow Layers
1. **RAW** → Source system data ingestion
2. **STAGING** → Data cleaning and standardization  
3. **CORE** → Business logic and dimensional modeling
4. **MARTS** → Financial reporting aggregations

#### Key Components
- **Fact Tables**: `fct_transactions` (partitioned by date, clustered by account)
- **Dimensions**: `dim_accounts` (with hierarchy), `dim_periods`, `dim_cost_centers`
- **Financial Reports**: `mart_balance_sheet`, `mart_income_statement`
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Real-time connected sheets for accountants

### 📊 **Expected Benefits**

#### Performance Improvements
- **Query Speed**: < 30 seconds for standard reports (vs. hours currently)
- **Data Freshness**: Daily automated refresh vs. manual updates
- **System Availability**: 99.9% uptime with cloud infrastructure

#### User Experience Enhancements
- **Accessibility**: 24/7 access from any device
- **Collaboration**: Real-time collaborative analysis in Google Sheets
- **Familiar Interface**: Leverage existing spreadsheet skills

#### Operational Advantages
- **Maintainability**: Modular dbt code vs. monolithic QlikSense scripts
- **Testing**: Automated data quality validation
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated lineage and model documentation
- **Scalability**: Cloud-native architecture handles growing data volumes

### 🚀 **Implementation Timeline**

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
- Environment setup and data discovery
- Core infrastructure and staging models
- Testing framework implementation

#### Phase 2: Core Models (Weeks 4-6)
- Dimensional modeling with account hierarchy
- Transaction fact table with incremental processing
- Performance optimization (partitioning/clustering)

#### Phase 3: Financial Reports (Weeks 7-9)
- Balance Sheet and P&L mart development
- Business validation and reconciliation
- User acceptance testing

#### Phase 4: Integration & Rollout (Weeks 10-12)
- Google Sheets Connected Sheets setup
- User training and documentation
- Production deployment and legacy system sunset

### 💰 **Cost-Benefit Analysis**

#### Investment Required
- **Development Time**: 12 weeks (Analytics Engineer + Data Engineer)
- **Infrastructure**: BigQuery and Google Workspace licenses
- **Training**: User adoption and change management

#### Cost Savings
- **Time Savings**: 80% reduction in report generation time
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated vs. manual processes
- **System Maintenance**: Reduced IT overhead
- **Scalability**: No need for QlikSense infrastructure upgrades

### 🔒 **Risk Mitigation**

#### Technical Risks
- **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive testing and parallel running
- **Performance**: Extensive load testing with full historical data
- **Integration**: Thorough Google Sheets connectivity validation

#### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Extensive training leveraging familiar Google Sheets interface
- **Accuracy**: Rigorous reconciliation procedures with legacy system
- **Business Continuity**: Phased rollout with fallback capabilities

### 📈 **Success Metrics**

#### Quantitative KPIs
- Report generation time: From hours to < 30 seconds
- System availability: 99.9% uptime target
- Data freshness: Daily vs. ad-hoc updates
- User adoption: 100% finance team migration within 30 days post-launch

#### Qualitative Benefits
- Improved month-end close efficiency
- Enhanced financial analysis capabilities
- Better collaboration among accounting team
- Foundation for advanced analytics and ML

### 🔮 **Future Roadmap**

#### Short-term (3-6 months)
- Advanced variance analysis automation
- Extended historical trend analysis
- Integration with additional financial systems

#### Medium-term (6-12 months)
- Machine learning for anomaly detection
- Predictive financial modeling
- Real-time streaming updates for critical accounts

#### Long-term (12+ months)
- Enterprise-wide financial data platform
- Advanced regulatory reporting automation
- Full financial planning and analysis integration

### ✅ **Recommendation**

**Immediate approval recommended** for this migration project based on:

1. **Critical Business Need**: Current system performance severely impacts month-end processes
2. **Proven Technology Stack**: dbt + BigQuery + Google Sheets is industry-standard
3. **Manageable Risk**: Phased approach with parallel running minimizes disruption
4. **Strong ROI**: Significant time savings and operational improvements
5. **Future-Proof**: Scalable foundation for advanced financial analytics

**Next Steps**: Secure stakeholder approval and begin Phase 1 environment setup immediately to address current system limitations before next quarter's close cycle.
